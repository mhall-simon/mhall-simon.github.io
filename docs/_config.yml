# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hey there, I'm a software engineer specializing in MLOps for financial,
  manufacturing, & other quantitative datasets. I build patterns and platforms
  to deliver results through low-code packages and no-code interactive applications.

  My blog posts are generally targeted towards teaching little pieces of useful
  things I've picked up, and hope you enjoy learning from them!
