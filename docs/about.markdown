Hey there, I'm Matt, a mid-senior level software engineer specializing in Machine Learning Engineering and Ops (MLOps),
designing ML-focused and democratized platforms and patterns for Corning Inc. I have a Master of Science
in Finance from Simon Business School, University of Rochester, and a Bachelor of Arts from New York University.

My professional experience has had me working with internal and external financial data and quantitative modeling,
underwriting criteria, inventory/order data, time series data, manufacturing data, and ML models, with results
being delivered to Wall St and C-level executives / senior finance leadership. Currently, I am the product owner 
and lead engineer of our new Forecasting patterns, building out automated and semi-supervised time series modeling, 
designed to be distributable over Databricks Apache Spark clusters with GPU acceleration.

My interests also include being my significant other's dance partner (she's a professional dance instructor),
photography, fashion, coffee, and breaking production environments (just kidding on the last one).
