I've deployed a lot of production applications to various systems, including
AWS, on-premises Kubernetes environments, and traditional servers. But, one
thing I've actually never done is deploy an application to Heroku!

I had some applications running in my personal AWS account for learning projects,
however, I have since ran out of free tier compute, and want to leverage something
that's free. I also deactivated my old website and am migrating all of my learning
materials into GitLab pages.

This post is going to be my learnings from deploying an older Dash application
into Heroku, and some exploration of the ML app itself too.
